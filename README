Mass-weighted coordinates \sqrt{m}x, momenta p/\sqrt{m} and forces F/\sqrt{m} are used in the code

a) The code 'main2.py' with 
      1) flagp = 0, flagVC = 0 generates pulsed laser results
              i) with flagw0 = 0 for w0 = 200 cm^-1 and tVC = 1.7 ps in PulseLow.txt and PulseLowT.txt
              ii) with flagw0 = 1 for w0 = 1700 cm^-1 and tVC = 1.7 ps in PulseHigh.txt and PulseHighT.txt

      2) flagp = 1, flagVC = 0 generates continuous-wave laser results
              i) with flagw0 = 0 for w0 = 200 cm^-1 and tVC = 1.7 ps in CWLow.txt and CWLowT.txt
              ii) with flagw0 = 1 for w0 = 1700 cm^-1 and tVC = 1.7 ps in CWHigh.txt and CWHighT.txt

b) The code 'mainFig5.py' with flagp =0, flagw0 = 0, and flagVC = 1 generates pulsed laser results for
   w0 = 200 cm^-1 and tVC = 1 ns and Epulse = 100 \muJ in EaPulseLow.txt 

c) The code 'plot.py' with
      1) flagp = 0, flagVC = 0
              i) and flagw0 = 0 generates Fig. 2b-c, 3 and 4 using PulseLow.txt and PulseLowT.txt
              ii) and flagw0 = 1 generates Fig. S1a-b, S2 and S3 using PulseHigh.txt and PulseHighT.txt

      2) flagp = 1, flagVC = 0
              i) and flagw0 = 0 generates Fig. 2e-f using CWLow.txt and CWLowT.txt
              ii) and flagw0 = 1 generates Fig. S1c-d using CWHigh.txt and CWHighT.txt

d) The code 'plotFig5.py' with flagp = 0, flagw0 = 0 and flagVC = 1 generates Fig. 5 using EaPulseLow.txt
